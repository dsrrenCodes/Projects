# EDA Project: Investigating Nobel Prize Winners

My Analysis of the Nobel Prize dataset using Pandas,Matplot and Seaborn. 


## Analysis
The analysis explores various aspects of data (in order), including:

- Which prizes were given out the most / which are the popular fields?
- How many of the winners belonged to organisation or worked independently 
- Which is the most commonly awarded birth country?
- What is the most commonly awarded gender?
- Top 5 Countries Nobel winners passed (died) in
- Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?
- Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?
- Who was the first woman/man to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
- Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?

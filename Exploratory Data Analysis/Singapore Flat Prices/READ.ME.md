The code can be found in my ipynb file.

* What kind of Resale Flat is the most popular in Singapore?
* What are the trends in the resale price of "4 room" flats in Singapore over the years?
* What are the average resale flat prices in the top 3 towns with the most number of resales and why do resale prices vary across the towns from 2017 to 2024?

 
## 1. What kind of Resale Flat is the most popular in Singapore?















- In Singapore, which towns had the highest number of flat resales from 2017 to 2024?

From the bar graph in Figure 1, the top 3 towns with the most number of flat resales are: 1) Sengkang with 14145 flat resales (Northeast) 2) Punggol with 12603 flat resales (Northeast) 3) Woodlands with 11966 flat resales (North)

On the other hand, the 3 towns with the least number of flat resales are: 1) Bukit Timah with 426 flat resales (Central) 2) Marine Parade with 1064 flat resales (Central) 3) Central Area with 1388 flat resales (Central)

It is interesting to note that all 3 towns are from the Central region, this may be because homeowners in these towns are more settled. Hence, there is less availability of resale flats.

- Which region in Singapore had the highest number of flat resales from 2017 to 2024?

From the pie chart in Figure 2, the top 3 regions with the most number of flat resales are: 1) Northeast Region - 26.8% 2) West Region - 22.8% 3) Central Region - 18.8%

Comparing the total number of resale flats from each region in Singapore, namely the Central, North, Northeast, East and West, the region with the highest number of resale flats is the Northeast region. This also corresponds to the data shown in Figure 1, where the top 2 towns are from the Northeast region.

- What flat type in Singapore had the highest number of flat resales from 2017 to 2024?

From the bar graphs in Figure 3, the top 3 flat types with the most number of flat resales are: 1) 4-Room flats with over 70000 flat resales, highest number of both Mature and Non-Mature resale flats. 2) 5-Room flats with around 41000 flat resales, second highest number of Non-Mature resale flats. 3) 3-Room flats with about 40000 flat resales, second highest number of Mature resale flats.

Hence, "4 Room" flats are the most popular in both Mature and Non-Mature resale flats.

In the bar graph of Figure 3.1, "4-Room" are the most popular type of resale flat in both categories of Mature and Non-Mature estates. We can break down the number of resale "4 Room" flats, where there is more Non-Mature resale "4 Room" flats than Mature resale "4 Room" flats by a significant margin of about 20 000. Thus, homeseekers in Singapore may prefer Non-Mature "4 Room" flats as there is a high demand and supply of "4 Room" resale flats overall as seen from the Figure 3.1.

In the bar graph of Figure 3.2, we can take a closer look at less popular resale flats, "Multi-Gen" and "1 Room" resale flats. From 2017 to 2024, in the "1 Room" flat type, it can be seen that there are only Mature resale flats. Additionally, there are also low numbers of both Mature and Non-Mature resale "Multi-Gen" flats. This may be because "Multi-Gen" flats are relatively new and there are lesser number of them.

From Figure 3.3, additionally, the top 3 towns with the highest number of resale flats observed from 2017 to 2024, namely Sengkang(Northeast), Punggol(Northeast) and Woodlands(North), agree with the bar graphs in Figure 3.1 and 3.2 that "4 Room" flats are the most popular flat type. Interestingly, the top 3 towns with the highest number of resale flats are all non-mature estates.

In conclusion, the most popular type of resale flat in Singapore from 2017 to 2024 are likely to be Non-Mature "4 Room" resale flats from Sengkang or the Northeast region.
## 2. What are the trends in the resale price of "4 room" flats in Singapore over the years?

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 From the line graph in Figure 4, the price of resale "4 room" flats from 2017 to 2019 remains quite consistent and the price only decreased by about $10k.

However, from 2019 to 2023, the price of resale "4 room" flats begin to skyrocket, increasing from about $420k to about \$570k. This is a $37.5k increase in "4 room" flat prices year on year from 2019 to 2023.

In 2024, if it continues increasing at its current rate, the average resale "4 room" flat prices in Singapore is projected to exceed $600k.

* Which months are the Resale Prices and Number of Resales of "4 room" flats in Singapore the highest or lowest?

â€‚From the line graph in Figure 5.1, the resale price of "4 room" flats in 2023...

In January to February showed a decrease from about $571k to \$564k.
From February to March has a sharp rise from about $564k to \$580k.
From May to July, the price of "4 room" flats seems to remain constant at about $581k.
In July to August, another sharp increase in price is observed from $581k to \$597k.
However, in the following month from August to September, the price falls back down to about $590k.
Lastly, in the months from September to December, the "4 room" flat prices show a small but steady increasing trend from $590k to \$598k.

In 2023, the highest the "4 room" flat resale price ever went was around $598k in August, while the lowest price of about \$564k was seen in February.

From the line graph in Figure 5.2, the price of "4 room" flats in 2018...

In January to February showed a decrease from about $435k to \$429k.
In February to March, there was a sharp increase from about $429k to \$446k.
From March to May, there is a steep decrease of more than $10k from about \$446k to $433k.
In the next few months from June to December, a consistent drop in price was shown, decreasing from $435k in June to \$423k in December.

In 2018, the highest the resale "4 room" flat price ever went was around $446k in March, while the lowest price of about \$423k was seen nearing the end of the year in the months of October and December.

In conclusion, from the line graphs in Figure 5.1 and 5.2, the resale prices of "4 room" flats in 2023 and 2018 both show a similar trend in the first few months of the year, from January to March. In both years, from January to February, there is a decrease in "4 room" flat prices by about $5k. On the other hand, from February to March, there is a sharp increase in "4 room" flat prices in both years, both rising by about \$15k. However, for the months in which the highest and lowest price of "4 room" flats was seen in both years may vary.

From the bar graph in Figure 6.1, from 2018 to 2023, comparing the average resale "4 room" flat prices for each month in these years, the lowest average "4 room" flat price was in the earlier month of February, while the highest average "4 room" flat price was in the month of December. However, the higher resale price in the months at the end of the year may also be due to the fact that from 2019 to 2023, the price of resale "4 room" flats steeply increased as shown in Figure 4.

Additionally from Figure 6.1, from 2018 to 2023, the average resale "4 room" flat prices is observed to have a sharp decrease in June and July. This could also be due to the fact the Hungry Ghost Festival is held during the 7th Month of the Chinese calendar, and there are superstitions to avoid moving houses during the 7th Month as it may attract bad luck. Additionally, a large proportion of the Singapore population is Chinese which are likely to celebrate the Hungry Ghost Festival.

From the bar graph in Figure 6.2, from 2018 to 2023,

In January to February, the number of flat resales decreased from about 5000 to 4200.
In Februay to March, there was a sharp increase in flat resales from around 4200 to 5400.
In March to May, the number of flat resales decreased from about 5400 to 4500.
In May to July, the number of flat resales show an increasing trend from 4500 to 5700.
In the last few months from July to December show a small but steady decrease each month, falling from 5700 to 5200 resales.

From Figure 6.1 and 6.2 in 2018 to 2023, both show an interesting correlation between "4 room" flat prices and number of "4 room" flat resales throughout the year. From March to May, when the prices of "4 room" flats increased, there was a decrease in number of "4 room" flat resales. From May to July, when the prices of "4 room" flats had a steep drop, there was a sharp increase in number of "4 room" flat resales. Nearing the end of the year, in the months between August and December, there was a small but steady decline in the prices of "4 room" flats, additionally, there was also a steady increase in the number of "4 room" flat resales. Furthermore, the highest number of "4 room" flat resales was observed in the month of July where the "4 room" flat prices were the second lowest throughout the year.

Thus, from Figure 6.1 and 6.2, there seems to be an inverse relationship between the two values, when the "4 room" flat prices increase, there is a decrease in "4 room" flat resales and vice versa.

However, from Figure 6.1 and 6.2, in the month of February, an anomaly is observed, where the price of the "4 room" flats are the lowest but the number of "4 room" flat resales are also the lowest. There are less transactions or purchases of resale flats during this period despite the fact that prices have dropped. A reason why this may be so is the occurence of Chinese New Year in February, where there may be less people planning to move and the fact that a large proportion of the Singapore population is Chinese, who are likely to celebrate Chinese New Year.

In conclusion, there is an observable trend in decrease of "4 room" flat resale prices in the months of February, June and July where it is likely to be one of the lowest priced throughout the year. Hence, the months of February, June and July would be the best time for homeseekers in Singapore to purchase a "4 room" flat for a lower price.
##  3. What are the average resale flat prices in the top 3 towns with the most number of resales and why do resale prices vary across the towns from 2017 to 2024?










* What are the average resale flat prices in the top 3 towns? Do resale prices vary in the 3 towns because of floor area?

From Figure 7 and 8, intriguingly, Woodlands has the lowest median resale price but it also has the highest median floor area.

On the other hand, in Sengkang and Punggol, the median resale price and floor areas of flats have no significant difference. This may be because they are both in the Northeast region where the HDB prices and floor plans could be similar.

Taking a closer look, the price range in Punggol compared to Sengkang is noteably wider, ranging from about $0.2 million to $1.3 million in Punggol compared to about $0.18 million to $1 million in Sengkang.

Hence, the median resale flat price in Woodlands is the lowest among the 3 towns, yet, Woodlands also has the highest median floor area although the resale flat price should increase as the flat size increases. From Figure 7 and 8, it is hard to tell if resale prices are influenced by floor area. In the next graph, I am going to breakdown the data by flat type to find out more.


* From the histplot/scatter plots in Figure 9,

2 room flat:

All 3 towns seem to generally have around the same 2 room resale flat price range at about $0.15 million to $0.4 million and have a floor area of about 42 sqm to 50 sqm.

3 room flat:

    Sengkang has a light visible concentration of resale flats with the price of $0.35 million and the floor area is about the 65 sqm to 70 sqm mark. It is also observed in Sengkang that there is a group of the 3 room resale flats that are overlapping with the 4 room resale flats in terms of floor area at about 85 sqm.
    Punggol has slightly visible concentrations of resale flats with the prices of $0.35 million and $0.45 million and the floor area is about the 65 sqm to 75 sqm mark.
    Woodlands has a very visible concentration of resale flats with the price of $0.32 million and the floor area is about the 65 sqm to 82 sqm mark. In Woodlands, Some of the 3 room resale flats are overlapping with the 4 room resale flats in terms of floor area at about 82 sqm.

Woodlands has the lowest and most consistent 3 room flat resale prices among the 3 towns while Punggol has the highest price range of 3 room flat resale prices among the 3 towns.

In Sengkang, although there is an anomaly group of 3 room resale flats have a higher floor area of 85 sqm than the other group of 3 room resale flats with a floor area of about 68 sqm, the price range is about the same, from $0.28 million to $0.55 million. The floor area does not seem to affect the price range of 3 room flats in Sengkang.

4 room flat:

    Sengkang has a very visible concentration of resale flats in the price ranges between $0.35 million to $0.6 million as well, with a floor area of about 92 sqm as well.
    Punggol has a very visible concentration of resale flats in the price ranges between $0.35 million to $0.6 million, with a floor area of about 92 sqm.
    Woodlands has very visible concentrations of resale flats with the prices of about $0.35 million, $0.4 million and $0.54 million, with a floor area of about 90 to 102 sqm as well. (greater floor area)

Most of the resale 4 room flats in Sengkang and Punggol have similar price ranges and floor areas, about $0.35 million to \$0.6 million and 92 sqm. On the other hand, there are a greater variety of 4 room flats in Woodlands as seen from the spread of multiple concentrations of 4 room resale flat price ranges and floor areas in Figure 9.3.

5 room flat:

    Sengkang has a visible concentration of resale flats in the price range between $0.38 million to $0.72 million, with a floor area of about 110 sqm to 115 sqm
    Punggol has a very visible concentration of resale flats in the price range between $0.4 million to $0.5 million, with a floor area of about 110 sqm. There is also a less visible concentration of flats with the resale prices between $0.5 million to $0.75 million with floor areas about 110 sqm to 115 sqm.
    Woodlands has a very visible concentration of resale flats in the price range between $0.38 million to $0.45 million, with a floor area of about 120 sqm to 125 sqm. In Woodlands, there are some overlapping of 5 room and executive resale flats in terms of floor area, about the 130 sqm mark as well. (greater floor area)

Punggol's 5 room flat resale prices have a much wider price range in comparison to the other 2 towns, from $0.35 million to \$1.22 million and a floor area that ranges about 110 sqm to 125 sqm and an anomaly group of 5 room resale flats in Punggol that have a floor area about 145 sqm. (anomaly in floor area size)

Sengkang's price range is lower compared to Punggol, from $0.35 million to \$0.95 million and also has a similar floor area size to Punggol of 110 sqm to 115 sqm.

In Woodlands, the price range is the lowest from $0.3 million to \$0.78 million, and the floor area ranges from 110 sqm to 140 sqm. In comparison to the other two towns, interestingly, the 5 room resale flats in Woodlands have a lower price range and higher floor area size range.

Executive:

    Sengkang has a slightly visible concentration of resale flats in the price range between $0.5 million to $0.65 million, with a floor area of about 125 sqm to 130 sqm. The price range of resale flats is between $0.45 million to $0.9 million, while the floor area ranges from 125 sqm to 145 sqm.
    Punggol does not have a visible concentration and the size of the green cluster is quite small. The resale flats are in the price range between $0.5 million to $0.8 million, with a floor area of about 125 sqm to 130 sqm.
    In Woodlands, the floor area of executive flats in Woodlands are generally much widespread between 130 sqm to 190 sqm. Additonally, the price ranges from $0.45 million to $1.1 million. (greater floor area by a large margin)

It is also noteworthy that the price range of Executive flats in Punggol are similar to the price range of Punggol's 5 room flats, however, this may be related to the anomaly group of 5 room resale flats in Punggol that have a floor area about 145 sqm that is comparable to the size of Executive flats in Punggol.

In summary, the 2 room, 3 room and 4 room flats in Sengkang and Punggol have similar resale prices and floor area sizes that increases as the room size increases. The floor area sizes of 2 room and 3 room resale flats for all 3 towns are similar but the resale price of Woodland's 2 room and 3 room flats are slightly less than the resale price in Sengkang and Punggol.

Furthermore, it can also be noted that the 4 room, 5 room and Executive resale flats in Woodlands also have a much larger floor area compared to the other 2 towns despite being priced lower in comparison to the resale price of the corresponding flat type from other 2 towns.


* Figure 9 conclusion:

â€‚ To summarise, from the histplot/scatter plots in Figure 9, we can also observe that across the different flat types, as the number of rooms of a flat increases, the floor area in square meters also increases and the resale price increases. In each town, as the flat size increases, the resale price increases. This indicates a correlation between the resale flat's price and the resale flat's floor area or flat type.

Nevertheless, it is also true that most of Woodlands' resale flats are priced lower compared to the other 2 towns in most of the flat types despite having a greater floor area size in general.

A reason why Woodlands' resale flats are priced lower despite the flats having a bigger floor area in general may be because Woodlands is a town that is located at the very edge of Singapore and may also be considered less developed in terms of amenities in the location. However, similarly, Punggol and Sengkang are also non-mature estates that may be considered less developed in terms of amenities in the location. Thus, there may be more factors in play that affects resale prices than just floor area and there is a need to do a further analysis on why there is still a price gap between Woodlands and the other 2 towns.


* Figure 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3:

â€‚ From Figure 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, we can see that Sengkang and Punggol's HDB resale flats remaining lease range from about 74 years to 96 years. In contrast, Woodland's HDB resale flats have a much wider distribution of remaining lease years, from about 49 years to 96 years. Hence, from the histogram in Figure 10.3 of Woodlands, it is observed that that there is a mix of much older and newer resale flats in Woodlands.

In addition, the older resale flats in Woodlands that have a significantly lower remaining lease years left, also have a notably significant reduced resale price. There is a price drop of about $100k to \$200k comparing resale flats with 70 to 80 remaining lease years and resale flats with about 50 to 60 remaining lease years in Woodlands. When the number of remaining lease years decreases, the resale flat prices decreases. Hence, there is a positive correlation between remaining lease years and resale flat price seen in Woodlands.

Additionally, the resale flats in Sengkang and Punggol are much newer as opposed to the wider array of old and new resale flats in Woodlands. Due to lesser remaining lease years left in older resale flats in Woodlands, the price range of the older resale flats in Woodlands are generally lower and is a reason why the average price of resale flats in Woodlands may be lower. This may be the reason why the average resale prices of flats in Woodlands are lower compared to the other 2 towns.

However, there is also an observable anomaly where newer resale flats at the 80 to 85 remaining lease years left having a lower resale price than resale flats in the 70 to 80 remaining lease years in the 3 towns.

Moreover, the presence of older resale flats in Woodlands from the 1970s could be a reason why resale flats in Woodlands have a greater median floor area than the resale flats from Sengkang and Punggol.

This is because Singapore is a small island city-state with limited land area and newer flats in Singapore may be constructed in smaller units to maximize land use efficiently.
Furthermore, in recent years in Singapore, the declining birth rate has contributed to a decrease in household sizes. This demographic shift has generated an increasing demand for more compact and manageable living spaces. As a result, there may be a growing supply of smaller flats to meet the changing preferences and needs of the population.
Another reason why newer flats could be smaller is that smaller flats can be more affordable for a broader segment of the population, making homeownership more accessible. Developers and policymakers may opt for smaller units to cater to the financial constraints of potential homebuyers

In summary, some reasons why resale flat prices may vary among the top 3 towns with the most number of resales are factors such as flat types, size of floor area and number of years left on remaining lease of the resale flat.

# EDA Project: Investigating NYC public schools

My Analysis of the NYC dataset using Pandas,Matplot and Seaborn


## Analysis
The analysis explores various aspects of data (in order), including:

- Top 10 math performing schools

- Bottom 10 math performing schools

- Distribution of math scores across NYC schools
    
- Math scores across districts

- Relationship between Math and Reading scores across districts
- Top 10 performing schools based on their SAT scores
- Deviation of SAT scores across districts


   

## Observations





In the dataset, the only missing data (Percentage tested) does not interfere with my analysis.

- Top 10 math performing schools

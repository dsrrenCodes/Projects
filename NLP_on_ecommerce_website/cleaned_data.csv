I have been an Intel user since long and this is my first AMD laptop. It seriously packs a good punch when it comes to gaming. RTX 3060 with a 165 hz screen and 16GB ram works like a charm. No major heating issues as the fans work well. Have been playing God of War, AC Valhalla on Ultra and it is smooth. Only con I noticed is the sound by Nahimic is pretty low and you have literally put it on full volume. Also storage is 512GB SSD which is a downgrade for laptops..."

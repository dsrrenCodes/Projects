# ML Project: Classifying Resumes

Utilized machine learning algorithms to classify the sector/industry to which the resume belongs.

Performed data preprocessing techniques, including data augmentation, to balance the target feature.

Conducted cross-validation among different algorithms using accuracy as the performance metric and ultimately decided on Random Forest.

Conducted Randomized Search to determine the best hyperparameters, resulting in 88 percent accuracy on unseen data.

Utilized Streamlit for the front end web and Pickle to store my model.
